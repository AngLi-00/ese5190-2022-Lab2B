### Feedback Questions

-	Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? Be specific, and quote any parts of the lab description relevant to your answer (e.g., "modify the PIO/DMA logic analyzer example to record a timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange while the BOOT button is pressed.") I will make particular notice of anything that seems underspecified (e.g., words whose meaning is not clear from context, or conflicting interpretations of a deliverable).  

   I think most of parts are not difficult to understand, what confused me were the lack of reading materials and imprecise course-goal. A lot of us spent so much time searching and learning from various and uneven resources from network. We don’t know the final goal so we just learn each part cursorily and didn’t know which part we should have a deep understanding. Based on these，I feel that I am more like a staff rather than a student.  

-	Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? E.g., "serial communication with Python," "aliased bitwise operations," "programming the PIO," etc. Be specific, and describe any lingering areas of confusion and/or anything that has helped you navigate them.  
N/A  

-	Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement? Again, be specific, citing any parts of the lab materials & your own code that are relevant to your answer.  
N/A  

-	What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties? Any other barriers you have faced to completing this assignment? Mention any students, repos, or other resources you have found helpful in completing the lab so far.  

   Working with my partners and learn from excellent students. Zhijing Yao and Rongqian Chen’s code helped me a lot to achieve lab2B’s goal.
